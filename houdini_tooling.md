# Houdini Procedural Worflows
A huge part of what has made the SimFirefighter project to run smoothly, has been the thoughtful pre-development work that has alllowed us to streamline asset creation through the use of procedural tools. In this case, Houdini procedurals.

Houdini, with its node based workflows, is the ultimate IDE for geometry construction. With a rich set of features, procedurally construcing geometry assets is a breeze. 
This is all integrated through the Houdini Engine plugin, alllowing our team to develop systematic worflows that manipulate geometric constructions through a nested backend system. 

### Constructing Digital Assets

It works by building a digital asset, which is a geometry file that exposes editable parameters that can be piped back through the pipeline to create updates live and on the fly. In our case, this has been 
extramly handy for constructing the dynamic elements of our firefighting map. We wanted to build systems that looked at expanding the gameplay expereince, and this would be extramly challanging without 
procedural generation, allowing us to construct the forest, foliage, and material placings without the procedural layering toolkit. 

In our case, we have begun placing the folliage and various mask layers to capture the expereince of a more emmersive map. What is neat about this workflow, all the construction elements flow through the pipeline
and are highly steppable for building new changes that give us flexibilities when edits are needed.

### The Map

In our most resent interation of the project, we have taken the steps to build the map around the fire combat stratergy, placing two water towers and visual feedback elements into the gameplay expereince.
With these toolings, we can quickly adapt that framework to capture the elements needed for the uererbase, making small tweaks in the visual production. In this case, we have chosen to use two water towers and a visual path 
that cuts through the map to highlight the fasest routes between them for helicopter refill.
