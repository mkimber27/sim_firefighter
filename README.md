# Sim Firefighter
**Senior Capstone Project**

## Overview  
Over the past four months, I’ve contributed to the development of *Sim Firefighter*, a resource management simulation game designed to educate players on the strategic allocation of firefighting assets. Our team followed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) strategy, allowing us to break down development into modular, goal-driven stages aligned with collaborative objectives.

The project is built in Unreal Engine and structured around a win/loss gameplay loop that reinforces the core learning outcomes. By implementing this basic game architecture early on, we were able to iterate meaningfully, refining user objectives and gameplay dynamics while ensuring the overall framework remained scalable.

## Development Pipeline  
My primary responsibility has been the design and maintenance of a robust collaboration pipeline tailored to the unique needs of our team and project. This included the deployment of a **custom Perforce Helix Core repository** to manage source control for our Unreal Engine assets.

In addition, I configured a **custom development environment** that integrates the **Houdini Engine Plugin**, enabling the team to generate highly customizable procedural 3D assets with efficiency and precision. This significantly accelerated content creation while maintaining high visual and technical fidelity.

Implementing this workflow required deep coordination across several platforms and partners. I engaged directly with support teams at **SideFX**, **Perforce**, and **Epic Games**, and collaborated closely with Oregon State University to align internal resources and permissions.

## Iteration and Strategic Pivoting  
As the project progressed, our team recognized the need to adapt our design strategy in response to time constraints and shifting development priorities. By reassessing our scope and refining our game loop, we were able to ensure a more agile and responsive production cycle — one that still delivers an engaging and educational experience to users.  

Looking ahead, our focus remains on stabilizing key game states, enhancing feedback systems, and delivering a final product that is both technically robust and meaningful in its educational impact.
